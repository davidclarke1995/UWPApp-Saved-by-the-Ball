					1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

					FA Community Shields. The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League,

					Europa League, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. In 
					addition, they became the only professional English club to have won every ongoing honour available
